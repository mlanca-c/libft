# Intro

 > [subject](subject.pdf)

 The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

 C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects. 
 Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

## How to use

 This program creates a library libft.a

 ```
 git clone git@github.com:mlanca-c/libft.git
 cd libft
 make
 ```
